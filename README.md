# Thomson scattering Cross-Section Calculator (TSC)

This project contains MATLAB code for calculate cross-sections assoicated with Thomson scattering from thermally excited plasma waves. A simple mathematical overview is provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/LLNL/Thomson-Scattering-Cross-Section-Calculator/wiki/Calculation-of-the-Thomson-Scattering-Cross-Section).

## Getting Started

Code can be imported into MATLAB using the built in [GIT interface](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/retrieve-from-git-repository.html).

Alternatively code can be downloaded and placed into a matlab accessible folder. All included dependencies must be accessible in the [matlab function search path](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/what-is-the-matlab-search-path.html?searchHighlight=search%20path&s_tid=srchtitle_search%20path_1).

The script "ThomsonScatteringTestScript.m" provides a worked example of how to use these functions to carry out a Thomson scattering cross-section calculation.

### Prerequisites

Requires a MATLAB licence to run. There are no other prerequisites to run these scripts.

## Built With

* [Faddeeva Package](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Faddeeva_Package) - A fast calculator for the Faddeeva function. This sits at the heart of the calulation of these cross sections. Credit goes to [Steven G. Johnson](https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/).
